suites:
# This test suite mimics the behavior of being in a cloud which supports block device mapping
# The loopback devices given in block_device_mapping_ephemeral<N> should be included in
# the test/cookbooks/fake cookbook's attributes so they get created while running
# the test. EC2 and openstack clouds follow this format.

# This test mimics the behavior of being in a google compute engine. The ephemeral disks
# are mapped to /dev/disk/by-id/google-ephemeral-disk-<N>. Loopback device matching the
# device index should be set in the test/cookbooks/fake cookbook's attributes
# so they get created. For example, the following attributes will require the creation of
# loopback devices "/dev/loop0" and "/dev/loop1"
